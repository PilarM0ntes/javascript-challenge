## Description
This repository contains two projects: UFO-level-1 and UFO-level-2 which include the following information.

## UFO-level-1
- Using the UFO dataset (static/js/data.js) provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, the code (static/js/app.js) appends a table to the web page (index.html) and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
- The code listens for events when the user inputs a date and hits enter or presses the "filter data" button. Once, this event has been confirmed that data uis updated based on the date provided.

## UFO-level-2
- In addition to the functionalities described on the previous section (UFO-level-1), the web page includes multiple input tags for the following filtering options:
  - date
  - city
  - state
  - country
  - shape
- The code reads the user's input and filters the data based on it.
